# Function-Caller-S1

This is just a super simple mod that runs ONLY on mono version of Schedule 1
It runs as soon as the mod is loaded and scans all active functions and logs them
so its easier to go back and see what function you need for whatever your tryna do

MADE FOR DEVS!
If you dont know what ur looking at, dont install the mod
